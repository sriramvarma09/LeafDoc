# PlantDiseaseDetection
This project utilizes a ResNet50-based model for the detection of plant diseases. The system is built using Python and features a user-friendly interface developed with Streamlit. With this application, users can predict diseases affecting plant leaves based on images provided.

Features
--------

*   Utilizes ResNet50 model for accurate disease detection.
*   User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
*   Capable of predicting diseases from images.
*   Dataset size approximately 7GB.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Plant Disease Detection, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

bashCopy code

`git clone <repository-url>`

2.  Install the necessary dependencies:

bashCopy code

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  Run the application:

bashCopy code

`streamlit run app.py`

4.  Access the application via the provided URL.

Usage
-----

1.  Upload an image containing a plant leaf.
2.  Click the "Predict" button.
3.  View the predicted disease label.

Dataset
-------

The dataset used in this project comprises images of plant leaves affected by various diseases. The size of the dataset is approximately 7GB. Due to its large size, it is not included in this repository. However, it can be obtained separately for training and testing purposes.
